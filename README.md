#Crawl-E
1.	OBJECTIVE 

What we aim to achieve through this project is the creation of a tool using which data can be abstracted from the internet with a website as our aid. The website acts as an intermediate medium and has been made using web development technologies. It has a user friendly and convenient user interface. 
The data extracted from the web is filtered using indexing methods and thus give the outcomes that are most apt according to the query of the user.

2. ABSTRACT

The project titled “Crawl-E” is based on the concept of web crawling, also referred to as spidering sometimes. The crawler is used as a medium to summon and extricate data and information from the internet. Its coding has been done in python language using the scraping framework technique. The crawler will be made to run on a website and would act as an aid to collect the desired data onto the console. 
It is a brilliant tool for web indexing and makes finding things on the internet much easier and hassle free. The web bot uses scrappy framework which allows it to access data and extract it using APIs. The use of python makes the code very compact and easy to comprehend. Python is a very powerful yet easy to understand language with a very simple syntax which further helps in making this project all the more interesting.

3. INTRODUCTION

With the rapid increase of technology and everything becoming digitalized, most of the knowledge and data we acquire these days is from the internet. But the internet is an ocean of webpages containing information of all sorts. So what to do to filter what meets our need? The answer is pretty straightforward and points to a medium through which we can categorize our data such that the requirement of the user is met out effectively and swiftly. Here is where a web crawler comes into the picture.
A web bot or crawler aids us in working with data on the web. It helps us to gather info which is useful and extract data from webpages on the internet. 
The project “Crawl-E” has a similar goal to accomplish. It is based on the idea of mining of data using a scraper. The popular programming language python has been used to achieve this. The bot runs using a website and fetches data onto the console from the internet. Scrapy is an exceedingly useful framework provided by Python to process and extricate data.

4. PROBLEM STATEMENT

In order to gather data we need something that can facilitate in reading through the web page and extracting desired information from it. The web crawler “Crawl-E” is the answer to this problem.
It acts as the intermediary between the user and the web to gather information and provide it to the user.

. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS

FOR WEB CRAWLER:

1.	Python 

Python is predominantly a dynamic typed programming language which was initiated by Guido van Rossum in the year 1989. The major design philosophy that was given more importance was the readability of the code and expressing an idea in fewer lines of code rather than the verbose way of expressing things as in C++ and Java . The other design philosophy that was worth mentioning was that, there should be always a single way and a single obvious way to express a given task which is contradictory to other languages such as C++, Perl etc. 

Python compiles to an intermediary code and this in turn is interpreted by the Python Runtime Environment to the Native Machine Code. The initial versions of Python were heavily inspired from lisp (for functional programming constructs). Python had heavily borrowed the module system, exception model and also keyword arguments from Modula-3 language .Pythons’ developers strive not to entertain premature optimization, even though it might increase the performance by a few basis points.


2.	GitBash

Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environment which helps in providing a layer for emulation for a Git command line experience. Full form of BASH is Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an OS through written commands. Bash is a popular default shell also on other Operating Systems like Linux and macOS. Git Bash is a package that installs Bash, some shared bash utilities, & Git on a Windows OS. 


The program needs some hardware and software requirements to run the application which are listed below:
1. Hardware requirements

•	Processor – i3
•	Hard Disk – 5 GB
•	Memory – 1GB RAM
•	Android device

2.	Software requirements
 
•	Python
•	Git Bash
